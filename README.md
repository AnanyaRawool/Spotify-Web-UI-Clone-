# Spotify-Clone-Frontend-UI-
A polished, responsive frontend clone of the Spotify web interface created to demonstrate strong skills in HTML, CSS, and layout structuring. This project replicates the visual aesthetics and structure of Spotify's homepage, including styled navigation, featured sections, and a responsive layout â€” all crafted without backend integration to keep the focus entirely on UI/UX design.
```
âœ… Clean and modern interface
âœ… Clickable UI elements for navigation and layout simulation
âœ… Fully responsive across desktop and mobile
âœ… Ideal for showcasing frontend development and design skills
```

ðŸŽ¯ This project was built purely for frontend practice and UI prototyping. It serves as a visual representation of how a media platform interface can be structured.
